Greetings! I am currently a Ph.D. student at [Elmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE) at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/). I obtained my M.S. degree from [Oakland University](http://www.oakland.edu/) in 2022, and my advisor are [Dr. Jia Li](https://www.secs.oakland.edu/~li4/) and [Dr. Hongwei Qu](https://www.secs.oakland.edu/~qu2/). I received my B.E. degree from the [Beijing Information Science & Technology University (BISTU)](https://english.bistu.edu.cn/), Beijing, China, in 2020. Prior to this, I spent my senior year at [Oakland University](http://www.oakland.edu/) as a visiting student in 2020.
