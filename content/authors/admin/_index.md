Greetings! I am currently a Ph.D. student at [Elmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE) at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/). I obtained my M.S. degree from [Oakland University](http://www.oakland.edu/) in 2022, and my advisor is [Dr. Jia Li](https://www.secs.oakland.edu/~li4/) and [Dr. Hongwei Qu](https://www.secs.oakland.edu/~qu2/). I received my B.E. degree from the [Beijing Information Science & Technology University (BISTU)](https://english.bistu.edu.cn/), Beijing, China, in 2020. Prior to this, I spent my senior year at [Oakland University](http://www.oakland.edu/) as an exchange student in 2019.

I am looking for a Ph.D. RA position in Fall 2022. My research interests focus on Sensor Applications, the Internet of Things, Signal Processing, and Machine Learning. My current research project is using passive radio frequency technology to realize 3D indoor positioning. Please feel free to email me if you have any questions!
