Greetings! I am currently a Ph.D. student in the [School of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE) at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/). I earned my M.S. degree from [Oakland University](http://www.oakland.edu/) in 2022 under the advisement of [Prof. Jia Li](https://www.secs.oakland.edu/~li4/) and [Prof. Hongwei Qu](https://www.secs.oakland.edu/~qu2/). Prior to that, I received my B.E. degree from [Beijing Information Science & Technology University (BISTU)](https://english.bistu.edu.cn/), Beijing, China, in 2020. Additionally, I spent my senior year as a visiting student at [Oakland University](http://www.oakland.edu/) in 2020.

Currently, I am serving as a Graduate Research Assistant at the [ION](https://www.cbrinton.net/research.html) research lab, advised by [Prof. Christopher G. Brinton](https://www.cbrinton.net/). Concurrently, I am actively collaborating with [Prof. Ziran Wang](https://ziranw.github.io/). At the moment, my primary research project centers on **Multimodal Federated Learning**. Please feel free to email me if you have any questions!
