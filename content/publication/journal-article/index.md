abstract: This paper presents a cost-effective pressure sensing system for object detection and identification. The pressure sensing system consists of a 27Ã—27 piezoresistive sensor array made of carbon composite Velostat, a signal processing subsystem for signal scanning, amplification, registration, and enhancement. A convolutional neural network is used to classify various objects through the pressure signals produced and processed by the sensing array. Based on systematic characterizations and calibrations of sensing materials and system sensitivity, three experiment setups are established to recognize 10 objects to be detected. In series of experiments, a pressure image data set consisting of 32264 frames of images is first assembled to represent the 10 objects. Contrast enhancement algorithm was used to process the pressure image data set and combined with a convolutional neural network ResNet-PI to classify the 10 objects. For pressure images collected with the preestablished three experiment setups, an overall accuracy of 0.9854 is achieved. Compared with other systems based on Velostat sensor array, the system demonstrated in this study features improvements in structural robustness, detection repeatability and system reliability, suggesting its potential applications in emerging areas including human-computer interaction and smart health monitoring.

abstract: Human monitoring applications in indoor environments depend on accurate human identification and activity recognition (HIAR). Single modality sensor systems have shown to be accurate for HIAR, but there are some shortcomings to these systems, such as privacy, intrusion, and costs. To combat these shortcomings for a long-term monitoring solution, an interpretable, passive, multi-modal, sensor fusion system PRF-PIR is proposed in this work. PRF-PIR is composed of one software-defined radio (SDR) device and one novel passive infrared (PIR) sensor system. A recurrent neural network (RNN) is built as the HIAR model for this proposed solution to handle the temporal dependence of passive information captured by both modalities. We validate our proposed PRF-PIR system for a potential human monitoring system through the data collection of eleven activities from twelve human subjects in an academic office environment. From our data collection, the efficacy of the sensor fusion system is proven via an accuracy of 0.9866 for human identification and an accuracy of 0.9623 for activity recognition. The results of the system are supported with explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methodologies to serve as a validation for sensor fusion over the deployment of single sensor solutions. PRF-PIR provides a passive, non-intrusive, and highly accurate system that allows for robustness in uncertain, highly similar, and complex at-home activities performed by a variety of human subjects.
