abstract: This paper presents a cost-effective pressure sensing system for
  object detection and identification. The pressure sensing system consists of a
  27×27 piezoresistive sensor array made of carbon composite Velostat, a signal
  processing subsystem for signal scanning, amplification, registration, and
  enhancement. A convolutional neural network is used to classify various
  objects through the pressure signals produced and processed by the sensing
  array. Based on systematic characterizations and calibrations of sensing
  materials and system sensitivity, three experiment setups are established to
  recognize 10 objects to be detected. In series of experiments, a pressure
  image data set consisting of 32264 frames of images is first assembled to
  represent the 10 objects. Contrast enhancement algorithm was used to process
  the pressure image data set and combined with a convolutional neural network
  ResNet-PI to classify the 10 objects. For pressure images collected with the
  preestablished three experiment setups, an overall accuracy of 0.9854 is
  achieved. Compared with other systems based on Velostat sensor array, the
  system demonstrated in this study features improvements in structural
  robustness, detection repeatability and system reliability, suggesting its
  potential applications in emerging areas including human-computer interaction
  and smart health monitoring.
