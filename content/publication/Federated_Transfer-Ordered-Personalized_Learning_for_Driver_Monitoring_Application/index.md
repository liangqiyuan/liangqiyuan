abstract: Federated learning (FL) shines through in the internet of things (IoT)
  with its ability to realize collaborative learning and improve learning
  efficiency by sharing client model parameters trained on local data. Although
  FL has been successfully applied to various domains, including driver
  monitoring application (DMA) on the internet of vehicles (IoV), its usages
  still face some open issues, such as data and system heterogeneity,
  large-scale parallelism communication resources, malicious attacks, and data
  poisoning. This paper proposes a federated transfer-ordered-personalized
  learning (FedTOP) framework to address the above problems and test on two
  real-world datasets with and without system heterogeneity. The performance of
  the three extensions, transfer, ordered, and personalized, is compared by an
  ablation study and achieves 92.32% and 95.96% accuracy on the test clients of
  two datasets, respectively. Compared to the baseline, there is a 462%
  improvement in accuracy and a 37.46% reduction in communication resource
  consumption. The results demonstrate that the proposed FedTOP can be used as a
  highly accurate, streamlined, privacy-preserving, cybersecurity-oriented,
  personalized framework for DMA.
