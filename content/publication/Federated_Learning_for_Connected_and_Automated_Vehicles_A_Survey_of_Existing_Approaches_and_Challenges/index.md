abstract: Machine learning (ML) is widely used for key tasks in Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAV), including perception, planning, and control. However, its reliance on vehicular data for model training presents significant challenges related to in-vehicle user privacy and communication overhead generated by massive data volumes. Federated learning (FL) is a decentralized ML approach that enables multiple vehicles to collaboratively develop models, broadening learning from various driving environments, enhancing overall performance, and simultaneously securing local vehicle data privacy and security. This survey paper presents a review of the advancements made in the application of FL for CAV (FL4CAV). First, centralized and decentralized frameworks of FL are analyzed, highlighting their key characteristics and methodologies. Second, diverse data sources, models, and data security techniques relevant to FL in CAVs are reviewed, emphasizing their significance in ensuring privacy and confidentiality. Third, specific and important applications of FL are explored, providing insight into the base models and datasets employed for each application. Finally, existing challenges for FL4CAV are listed and potential directions for future work are discussed to further enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of FL in the context of CAV.
