abstract: Passive radio frequency (PRF)-based indoor positioning systems (IPS)
  have attracted researchersâ€™ attention due to their low price, easy and
  customizable configuration, and non-invasive design. This paper proposes a
  PRF-based three-dimensional (3D) indoor positioning system (PIPS), which is
  able to use signals of opportunity (SoOP) for positioning and also capture a
  scenario signature. PIPS passively monitors SoOPs containing scenario
  signatures through a single receiver. Moreover, PIPS leverages the Dynamic
  Data Driven Applications System (DDDAS) framework to devise and customize the
  sampling frequency, enabling the system to use the most impacted frequency
  band as the rated frequency band. Various regression methods within three
  ensemble learning strategies are used to train and predict the precise
  positions of the receiver. The PRF spectrum of 60 positions is collected in
  the experimental scenario, and three criteria are applied to evaluate the
  performance of PIPS. Experimental results show that the proposed PIPS
  possesses the advantages of high accuracy, configurability, and robustness.
