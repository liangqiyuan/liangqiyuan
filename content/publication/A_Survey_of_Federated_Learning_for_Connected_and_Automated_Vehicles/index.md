abstract: Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) are one of the emerging
  technologies in the automotive domain that has the potential to alleviate the
  issues of accidents, traffic congestion, and pollutant emissions, leading to a
  safe, efficient, and sustainable transportation system. Machine learning-based
  methods are widely used in CAVs for crucial tasks like perception, motion
  planning, and motion control, where machine learning models in CAVs are solely
  trained using the local vehicle data, and the performance is not certain when
  exposed to new environments or unseen conditions. Federated learning (FL) is
  an effective solution for CAVs that enables a collaborative model development
  with multiple vehicles in a distributed learning framework. FL enables CAVs to
  learn from a wide range of driving environments and improve their overall
  performance while ensuring the privacy and security of local vehicle data. In
  this paper, we review the progress accomplished by researchers in applying FL
  to CAVs. A broader view of the various data modalities and algorithms that
  have been implemented on CAVs is provided. Specific applications of FL are
  reviewed in detail, and an analysis of the challenges and future scope of
  research are presented.
