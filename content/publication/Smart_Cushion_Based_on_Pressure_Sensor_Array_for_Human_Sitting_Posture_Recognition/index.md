abstract: A smart cushion based on a pressure sensor array is designed and
  manufactured to recognize human sitting posture. The smart cushion collects
  pressure images for convolutional neural network training to recognize 5 human
  sitting postures. In a series of experiments, a total of 16,300 pressure
  images were collected by 5 subjects to perform recognition tasks. By
  collecting pressure images multiple times to optimize the time independence of
  the data set, and the accuracy achieved 0.978. While ensuring comfortness,
  this smart cushion takes into account both the high accuracy of sitting
  posture recognition and the development prospects of visualization
  applications.
