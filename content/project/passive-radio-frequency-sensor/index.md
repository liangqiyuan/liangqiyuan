**How to achieve radio frequency (RF) sensing without assuming any transmitter?** Passive RF systems are capable of receiving ambient RF signals without deploying new transmitters, transmitting, rejecting, or shielding RF signals. Moreover, it is also unaware of the RF signals and does not require any a priori information about the existence of RF transmitters. In our work, we have conducted vast experiments on passive RF systems in diverse scenarios, including subject authentication, localization, activity recognition, and more. In addition to human sensing, we have also extended the application of passive RF systems to 3D indoor positioning tasks, which have exhibited surprising performance. Our goal is to promote the development of passive RF systems for wireless sensing in a comprehensive manner. We believe that passive RF systems have enormous potential for a wide range of sensing applications and can pave the way for a new generation of wireless sensing technologies.
