Passive radio frequency (RF) systems are capable of receiving ambient RF signals without the need for deploying new transmitters, nor transmitting, rejecting, or shielding RF signals. Moreover, these systems operate without awareness of the RF signals and do not require prior knowledge about the presence of RF transmitters. In our work, we have conducted extensive experiments with passive RF systems across various scenarios, including subject authentication, localization, activity recognition, and more. Beyond human sensing, we have expanded the use of passive RF systems to 3D indoor positioning tasks, which have demonstrated exceptional accuracy and efficiency. We aim to spearhead the evolution of passive RF systems in wireless sensing, confident in their immense potential across a broad spectrum of sensing applications and foreseeing their role in heralding a new era of wireless sensing technologies.
