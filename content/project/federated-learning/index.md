**How to make each client happy?** Federated learning is a collaborative technology that enables multiple clients to share knowledge while ensuring privacy, high efficiency, and low communication overhead. Our work focuses on delivering personalized, human-centered federated learning services. In addition to client-to-server federated learning, we are also fostering the development of peer-to-peer federated learning, including communication protocols, network topologies, paradigms, and variants. Our ultimate vision is to realize a fair, incentivized, and interpretable peer-to-peer federated learning system deployed on vehicular networks, research institutions, and mobile services.
