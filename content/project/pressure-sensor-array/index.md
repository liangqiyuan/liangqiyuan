Pressure is a fundamental modality of human sensing. With the designed, constructed, and characterized polymer composite material Velostat, pressure sensor arrays benefit from its flexible material properties and affordability, making them an ideal choice for applications in flexible textiles, wearable sensors, and smart home systems. Our research progresses to a practical case study on everyday object recognition, subsequently expanding to applications in sitting and sleeping posture analysis, and human activity recognition. We believe that the proposed pressure sensor system has significant potential in various domains, including healthcare, sports, gaming, early childhood education, and entertainment. Looking ahead, we are enthusiastic about the commercial prospects of this technology, envisioning its integration into products, such as an additional modality sensor for the Nintendo Switch Ring Fit Adventure.
