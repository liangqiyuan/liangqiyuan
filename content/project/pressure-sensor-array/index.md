Pressure is a fundamental modality of human sensing. Our work begins with the design, construction, and characterization of a polymer composite material Velostat-based pressure sensor array. Through a series of experiments, we evaluate the nonlinear electrical properties and crosstalk of the sensor array. From there, we progress to a case study on object recognition and then expand our scope to include applications such as sitting posture, sleeping posture, and dynamic activity recognition. We believe that the proposed pressure sensor system has significant potential in various domains, including healthcare, sports, gaming, early childhood education, and entertainment. Looking ahead, we are excited about the possibility of commercializing the technology, such as creating a product supplement for the Nintendo Switch Ring Fit Adventure.
