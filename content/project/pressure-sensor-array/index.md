Pressure, a fundamental modality of human sensing, is at the core of our work, which begins with designing, constructing, and characterizing the polymer composite material Velostat for a pressure sensor array. Its flexible material properties and affordability make it an ideal choice for applications in flexible textiles, wearable sensors, and smart home systems. Our research progresses to a practical case study on everyday object recognition, subsequently expanding to applications in sitting and sleeping posture analysis, and human activity recognition. We believe that the proposed pressure sensor system has significant potential in various domains, including healthcare, sports, gaming, early childhood education, and entertainment. Looking ahead, we are enthusiastic about the commercial prospects of this technology, envisioning its integration into products, such as an additional modality sensor for the Nintendo Switch Ring Fit Adventure.
